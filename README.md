GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's alt tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
